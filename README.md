# BRS_RP2040

Basic Runtime System for the RP2040 platform.
Gets the hardware to startup and execute to main()

This is originally based off the excellent example code from [dwelch67](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi-pico.git) who deserves 99% credit for the startup code.
In version 1.00.00, I've basically just copied his work for my own use.
In version 1.01.00 I've refactored the code for my own purposes and understanding. I'll keep his [README.txt](./doc/README.txt) in the /doc/ folder for posterity and tracking purposes.
In the future, I will adapt my licensing documentation to be consistent with Welch's.
